    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p>
        KJ Bakeries is one of my very first bakery ventures — a dream shaped by years 
        of craving real, premium cakes. Growing up, the only cakes easily accessible 
        were packet cakes or basic pastries. The creamy, rich, heavenly cheesecakes 
        and gourmet-style desserts we see today were almost impossible to find.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I decided to bring those flavors to life. KJ Bakeries is built on passion, 
        creativity, and the desire to make truly delightful cakes available to everyone. 
        Every dessert here is made with the dedication to offer the taste I always wished 
        I could enjoy earlier — soft, indulgent, fresh, and worth every bite.
